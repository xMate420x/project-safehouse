  AKA How I learned to stop worrying and defend my home

# Introduction

I have been through several break-ins in the past, so one day I thought that there needs to be something done to prevent them. Project Safehouse was born, after a long time of thinking about possibilities of varying complexity for securing my house. I choose the one with the most security, while still being affordable enough to be possible.

I used as few as possible pre-made components, as rolling your own can have a lot of savings. I will detail everything I made myself as they get introduced later down on the road, for now so we don't need to worry about that.
